# Boto3

## [Resource vs Client vs Session](https://www.askvikram.com/difference-between-boto3-session-resource-client/)

### Resource

Resources are a higher-level abstraction compared to clients. They are generated from a JSON resource description that is present in the boto library itself. E.g. this is the resource definition for [S3](https://github.com/boto/boto3/blob/73865126cad3938ca80a2f567a1c79cb248169a7/boto3/data/s3/2006-03-01/resources-1.json).

Resources provide an object-oriented interface for interacting with various AWS services.

### Client

Clients provide a low-level interface to the AWS service. Their definitions are generated by a JSON service description present in the [botocore library](https://github.com/boto/botocore). The botocore package is shared between boto3 as well as the [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli).

The service definition for AWS S3 is stored as a JSON under the [botocore package](https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/develop/botocore/data/s3/2006-03-01/service-2.json).

### Summary

To summarize, resources are higher-level abstractions of AWS services compared to clients. Resources are the recommended pattern to use boto3 as you don’t have to worry about a lot of the underlying details when interacting with AWS services. As a result, code written with Resources tends to be simpler.

However, Resources aren’t available for all AWS services. In such cases, there is no other choice but to use a Client instead.
