# Puppet

## Filebucket

[Resource](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.17/man/filebucket.html)

Go to `/var/lib/puppet/clientbucket/<m/d/5/hashsum_dir>` and you will find the contents and paths of what was changed.

That MD5 hashum of the contents that were changed from is what you need to cd into.

## Debugging puppet catalog variables

Add a notify block and run the debug command above:

```json
notify { 'r1_plugin_version':  
Â  message => "r1 plugin version = ${r1soft_plugin_version}"  
}
```

```shell
puppet agent -t
```
